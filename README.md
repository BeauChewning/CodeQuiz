## Description
Link to page: https://github.com/BeauChewning/CodeQuiz

My motivation for creating this project was test what i could do and i i still have along way to go.


I built this project because I wanted to practice what ive learnt and then show the people i know with an iteractive quiz.


 It does not really solve a problem but it helps me learn so I had fun with it.


I learnt alot with javascript on this project. I learnt about time functions if else statements and functions. I may not grasp them 100% but my understanding has grown.
